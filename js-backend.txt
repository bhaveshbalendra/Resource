IN JS Backend

 1)
npm init -y
npm i express
node index.js -> in this steps we need to restart the server each time 

2)
we can use nodemon as dev in script 
"dev":"nodemon index.js"
"start":"node index.js"

start or server
dist or build
npm i cpx
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "build": "cpx \"src/**/*\" dist/",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"  
  },



so in this we can directly run backend in the production node src/index.js but when we have
assist or other static file its best to build because it minimnize and optize in dist folder 
the run it from there in production its your choise to run in dist or src in development mode
cpx copy all file from src to dist .here  \"src/**/*\"    \"  \" between this two we can have 
command to run concrueently  eg: -> "dev" or "serve" : "concurrently \"npx tsc -w\" \"nodemon dist/index.js\""
here concurrently is package

& -> between two means run parallely but this is only for window so we use concurrently
eg: "dev" : "npx tsc -w & nodemon dist/index.js"

&& -> this will run sequentially first npx tsc finsh then nodemon in this tsc run indefinitely in watch mode second command wont execute
eg: "dev" : "npx tsc -w && nodemon dist/index.js"
